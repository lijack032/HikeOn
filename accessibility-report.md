# Accessibility Report of HikeOn

## Adherence to the Universal Design Principles:
1) Equitable Use: The user interface of HikeOn provides the same means for all of its users. It doesn't provide extra features nor does it provide fewer functionalities for different users.

2) Flexibility in Use: HikeOn has only visual interaction between its user and the user interface. Therefore, it is unfortunate that HikeOn has only one form of response but doesn't include
others such as an audible response return to the user. We could have implemented an AI that can talk to its users, which would be more flexible in terms of interacting with the
users.

3) Simple and Intuitive Use: The user interface of HikeOn is fairly simple and intuitive to use. Once logged in, all the user needs to do is enter a location and click the buttons. This does not
require any complex operation or understanding of comprehensive concepts.

4) Perceptible Information: As above, HikeOn only returns visual information. This is disadvantageous to users who have impairment in their visual senses. As such, it is similar to the above that
we could have implemented a talkable AI so that it is easier for users to retrieve information from HikeOn.

5) Tolerance for Error: HikeOn does not have an undo button. Currently, once the user clicks logout, they would be immediately logged out. Hence, it is reasonable to add a pop frame that
confirms with the user about logging out. This would prevent unwanted accidental usage of the app.

6) Low Physical Effort: Using HikeOn doesn't require the user to be physically active. All they need to do is simply enter a location and press one of the three buttons. This can be performed
when sitting in a wheelchair, lying on the bed, etc.

7) Size and Space for Approach and Use: The user interface adheres to this principle. There are three buttons and one text field displayed on the main interface. All of them can be easily seen
by the users as they each have a different color. Users can also comfortably reach to all components of HikeOn.

## User Demographics
1) As can be seen from [this article](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/4316-more-canadians-getting-active-outside) by Statistics Canada, about 52% of Canadian households participate in 
hiking, running, rollerblading, and cross-country run in 2021. As a result, since the whole purpose of HikeOn is to provide convenient usage for those who enjoy outdoor activities such as
hiking, we would be selling it to all those individuals who participate in outdoor exercises. In other words, we would mainly target outdoor enthusiasts 
and adventure seekers who value planning their activities efficiently. This group includes hikers, campers, and travelers who often look for trails and natural attractions while wanting
insights into weather conditions and proximity to key locations. Additionally, we would also pay attention to families and individuals new to outdoor exploration. They could benefit from HikeOne's 
user-friendly interface and comprehensive recommendations.

2) As HikeOn specializes in outdoor activities, it is highly likely that individuals who prefer indoor activities will not use it as much as those who prefer outdoor's. Moreover, as HikeOn
relies intensively on the internet, it is also possible that those who enjoy adventuring in the extreme wild (thus no internet) prefer other applications or devices over it. Furthermore, as
HikeOne currently is not compatible with identifying wheelchair-friendly trails or providing audio navigation, people with disability might limited utility in HikeOn. This might cause the user
demographic to be less diverse and less equitable. Perhaps in future iterations, this can be better addressed and improved.
